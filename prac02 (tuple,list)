/*Considera showroom ofelectronic products, where there are various salesmen. Each salesman is given a commission of 5%, depending on the sales made per month. In case
the sale done is less than 50000, then the salesman is not given any commission. Write a function to calculate total sales of a salesman in a month, commission and 
remarks for the salesman. Sales done by each salesman per week is to be provided as input. Use tuples/list to store data of salesmen. Assign remarks according to the
following criteria:
Excellent : Sales>=80000
Good: Sales>=60000 and <80000
Average: Sales>=40000 and <60000
WorkHard: Sales<40000*/
